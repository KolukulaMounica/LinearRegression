## Building Regression models




### 1) Linear Regression

This model predicts the price of the houses in USA by taking the parameters such as Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms, Area Population.

Attached a CSV file for the data.


### 2) Logistic Regression

This model predicts whether the user clicked on the advertisement (or not) based on some parameters such as Daily Time Spent on Site,	Age,	Area Income,	Daily Internet Usage etc.

### 3) K Nearest Neighbours

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.

### 4) Decision tree & Random forest classifier

This model takes the loan data and based on some information such as purpose, interest rate, installments, annual increments etc., it predicts whether the customer has fully paid their loan amount or not. The decision tree classifier helps in predicting this. Also,  the Random forest classifier is an ensemble model of Decision tree clasifier and takes the n_estimators as a parameter.
